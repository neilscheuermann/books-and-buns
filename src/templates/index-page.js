                Iâ€™m Lindsay. Seven years ago, I wanted to write a book, but had
                no idea where to start. I went to conferences, read books,
                listened to podcasts and wrote a lot. Basically I learned the
                hard way so that you donâ€™t have to. Whether you need hand
                holding from beginning to end, or just another set of eyes on
                your finished manuscript, Iâ€™m here to help! Think of me as your
                book coach and #1 fan rolled up in one.

                I'm Bee, a linguist who lingers on words and creative ideas. I
                believe how we share our messages with the world creates our
                impact. I find myself taking notes on the media I consume in my
                free time to clarify the messages just that much more... so you
                could say it has become somewhat of an obsession.
