                We canâ€™t get enough of it! Often we will be chatting about a

                I'm Lin. Reading has always provided me a safe-haven, so now
                bringing stories into existence is my life. I get passionate
                about stories because they frame the way we understand our
                lives. If you have a story to tell, I am here to share my
                expertise and encouragement.

                I'm Bee, a linguist who lingers on words and creative ideas. I
                believe how we share our messages with the world creates our
                impact. I find myself taking notes on the media I consume in my
                free time to clarify the messages just that much more... so you
                could say it has become somewhat of an obsession.
